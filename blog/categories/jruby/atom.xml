    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Hello, world</h1>

<p>I write code. I leared to write code at age 10; I wrote BASIC on an Apple IIe. I then moved on to AppleScript, a language that I still use today to boss Mac apps around. At my current job, I write mostly Ruby code, building APIs and other tools for teams inside a large financial institution. While I currently deploy on MRI, I am a big fan of JRuby and I plan to port most of my APIs over to JRuby, so expect several posts on deploying JRuby.</p>

<p>I also write Cocoa and iOS applications for fun and profit. While I write my iOS applications in Objective-C, I write my Cocoa apps with MacRuby. With MacRuby, I get full access to AppKit and Foundation from Ruby, even on the command line, not to mention the ability to create great interfaces in Xcode.</p>

<p>Other languages that I'm interested in include LISP, Clojure, JavaScript, Factor, and R. I admit that it's an eclectic mix, but I trained to be a lawyer, so I never had to learn about functional languages or stack languages. I'm still baffled my LISP macros, but I vow to conquer them.</p>

<p>My goal for this blog is to contribute what I've learned back to the community. Many people contributed to my success and I hope to return the favor.</p>
