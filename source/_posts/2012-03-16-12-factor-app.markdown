Richard Schneeman from Heroku will be presenting the [12 Factor App](http://www.12factor.net) at the charlotte.rb meeting next Wednesday night at Packard Place. I read through the website and I'm interested to see how the 12 Factor App compares to how I've architected some of my systems. I've already found a few changes that I should make. I'm also interested to see how the 12 Factor App differs from an environment like [Torquebox](http://www.torquebox.com), which handles many of these factors for you.
