I write code. I leared to write code at age 10; I wrote BASIC on an Apple IIe. I then moved on to AppleScript, a language that I still use today to boss Mac apps around. At my current job, I write mostly Ruby code, building APIs and other tools for teams inside a large financial institution. While I currently deploy on MRI, I am a big fan of JRuby and I plan to port most of my APIs over to JRuby, so expect several posts on deploying JRuby.

I also write Cocoa and iOS applications for fun and profit. While I write my iOS applications in Objective-C, I write my Cocoa apps with MacRuby. With MacRuby, I get full access to AppKit and Foundation from Ruby, even on the command line, not to mention the ability to create great interfaces in Xcode.

Other languages that I'm interested in include LISP, Clojure, JavaScript, Factor, and R. I admit that it's an eclectic mix, but I trained to be a lawyer, so I never had to learn about functional languages or stack languages. I'm still baffled my LISP macros, but I vow to conquer them.

My goal for this blog is to contribute what I've learned back to the community. Many people contributed to my success and I hope to return the favor.
