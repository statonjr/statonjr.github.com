I bought _Land of Lisp_ a year ago when it first came out. I read through the book and did a few examples, but never gave it my full attention. I think the chapter on macros made my head spin a bit and then I got sidetracked. While waiting at the airport this week, I decided to take another look, but this time with my full attention. By "full attention", I mean completing the examples and _learning_ how LISP works. I'll blog my notes, too. Look for a blog post soon about getting set up.
